- Artificial Intelligence: Algorithm that mimicks the behaviour of human beings.
- Machine Learning: an algorithm that is able to learn from data to improve their performance at some task with experience
- Representation Learning: Learning how to represent the data. Representation learning, also known as feature learning, automatically extracts meaningful data representations to enhance machine learning tasks like classification and clustering. It eliminates the need for extensive manual feature engineering, advancing the field significantly.Examples of representation learning techniques include autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec and GloVe) for natural language processing, and many others.
- Deep learning: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on the use of artificial neural networks, particularly deep neural networks, to model and solve complex tasks.

### Learning types

- Supervised learning : Training data includes desired outputs
- Unsupervised learning : Training data doesnot include desired outputs
- Weakly or Semi-supervised learning : Training data includes few outputs
- Reinforcement learning : Rewards from sequence of actions.
